We will first check whether all the required packages are installed on your computer. Then we will continue with the introduction to Python.

Those that have their computer ready and are allready familiar with Python do not need to come to this lecture.

# Lecture 02
## 30. August 2021, 12.15 Landmålerhallen
We continue with the demonstration on how a simple structure can be designed in order to __minimize the risk__. The optimization could be the foundation for identifying sufficiently low failure probabilities, i.e. sufficient safety. We will discuss the implications and challenges. 

## Prepare:
* Compendium: Read the Chapter 00 and Chapter 01 until and including 1.4. You find the compendium on Blackboard.
* In addition, you can read the chapter 2 in [this book.](https://folk.ntnu.no/jochenk/SED5_3rd%20edition.pdf) (Not necessarily until Monday)
* Make sure that you have the necessary python packages on your computer. Follow the procedure on [this guide](GetStartedPython). If you have problems or questions, participate in the session 1015h (see above). 

## Good to know:
* The lecture room is ["Landmålerhallen"](https://use.mazemap.com/#v=1&config=ntnu&zlevel=0.5&center=10.405957,63.414996&zoom=18&sharepoitype=poi&sharepoi=73163&campusid=1).
