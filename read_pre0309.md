# Exercise 01.

In this first exercise class I will demonstrate the implementation of a structural engineering optimisation problem. 

## Prepare:
* Compendium: Read the Chapter 00 and Chapter 01 until and including 1.4. You find the compendium on Blackboard.
* Look at the exercises E1.1.1-3.

## Good to know:
* The lecture room is ["Landmålerhallen"](https://use.mazemap.com/#v=1&config=ntnu&zlevel=0.5&center=10.405957,63.414996&zoom=18&sharepoitype=poi&sharepoi=73163&campusid=1). 


## Recording:
The lecture will be automatically recorded. But better appear physically, when possible.
