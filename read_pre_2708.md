# Lecture 01
## 27. August 2021, 10.15 R10
In this first lecture of TKT4196 - Aspects of Structural Safety, 
a __general overview__ of the course is given. 
After going through the practical and organisational aspects related to the course imple- mentation, 
we will have a brief discussion on the role of safety aspects in structural engineering and in civil engineering in general. 
This lecture is meant to be a soft and “not too technical” start to the course and to the topic.

## Prepare:
If you have time, read the Chapter 00 that you find on Blackboard.

## Good to know:
The lecture room is [R10](https://use.mazemap.com/#v=1&config=ntnu&zlevel=5&center=10.406346,63.415651&zoom=18&sharepoitype=poi&sharepoi=873854&campusid=1) and at least for me it was a challange to find it. It is in Realfagbygget on the 5th floor. 
Use the elevator next to the library main entrance.

## Recording:
I will make an attempt to record the lecture. But better appear physically, when possible.

# Practical 00
## 23. September 2021, 12.15 Landmålerhallen
Here we will get our __computers ready__ to operate Python. I will also give you an introduction to some basics in scripting Python. 

## Prepare:
* If you have time, you might follow [this guide](GetStartedPython) and try to make your computer ready. 
* You could also have a look to the [Jupyter Notebook](P00-Introduction to Python.ipynb) that contains some introduction.

## Good to know:
The lecture room is ["Landmålerhallen"](https://use.mazemap.com/#v=1&config=ntnu&zlevel=0.5&center=10.405957,63.414996&zoom=18&sharepoitype=poi&sharepoi=73163&campusid=1). 
It is in the IBM building, floor s, entrance north-west corner.

## Recording:
I will make an attempt - but this session will be kind of interactive, so recordings might be of limited use.
