# Lecture 01
## 27. August 2021, 08.15 Landmålerhallen
It is demonstrated how a simple structure can be designed in order to __minimize the risk__. The optimization could be the foundation for identifying sufficiently low failure probabilities, i.e. sufficient safety. We will discuss the implications and challenges. 

## Prepare:
* Compendium: Read the Chapter 00 and Chapter 01 until and including 1.4. You find the compendium on Blackboard.
* Make sure that you have the necessary python packages on your computer. Follow the guidance on [this guide](GetStartedPython). If you have problems or questions, do not hesitate and ask. 

## Good to know:
* The lecture room is ["Landmålerhallen"](https://use.mazemap.com/#v=1&config=ntnu&zlevel=0.5&center=10.405957,63.414996&zoom=18&sharepoitype=poi&sharepoi=73163&campusid=1). 
* You find simple routines to start Jupyter Notebook or Spyder in this [little note.](CheatSheet) 

## Recording:
The lecture will be automatically recorded. But better appear physically, when possible.
