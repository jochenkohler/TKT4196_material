Implementing First Order Reliability Method (FORM)

Prepare:
--------

-   Compendium: Have Chapter 3 read, download and go through the corresponding
    [Jupyter Notebook.](E3_1.ipynb)

### Your learning objective for this first reading is:

-   You understand how a reliability problem with two variables can be
    represented in a 3 dimensional diagram (like the one in Figure 3.1 (left))

-   You capture the transformation from "x-space" to "u-space" ((like the one in
    Figure 3.1 left to right)

-   You see that the alpha-values are direction cosinuses

-   You identify the iteration procedere in the "Example: Non-linear Safety
    Margin"

-   You have opend the [Jupyter Notebook] and you understand the main procedure.
    You looked up some unknown python methods on the corresponding documentation
    on the web.

Good to know:
-------------

-   In the class, you will first implement your own python skript for FORM
    analysis in Spyder (very much inspired by the solution given in the
    notebook).

-   Then you will be asked to implement a very simple exampel of a tension rod
    with uncertain load $$S$$, material resistance $$R$$ and cross section area
    $$A$$.  Therefor you have to make the corresponding adjustment in your code.

Recording:
----------

The will be no recording of the practical class.
